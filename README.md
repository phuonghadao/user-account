need to install node.js and npm -> https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac

open the folder in your workspace

open terminal -> run 
npm init 
-> then keep 'Enter' -> there will be 'package.json' in your folder

next run 
npm i express ejs

npm i --save-dev nodemon dotenv

npm run devStart (this will refresh server and reload the code evertime there are changes)

npm i bcrypt

npm i passport passport-local express-session express-flash

npm i method-override

to run -> open terminal -> go to the directory of the folder -> run node server.js
then go to browser -> search localhost:1000

if the program not working, in server.js line 92, you can change the port to any number you like then try run the program again

send me a message if you have any problems
